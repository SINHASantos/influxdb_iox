// Every modification to a database is represented as an entry. These can be forwarded
// on to other IOx servers or can be wrapped with a sequence number for ordering in
// a WAL or subscribers.
//
// Take the example of sharding, where an IOx server is configured to split an
// incoming write into shards and send them onto others. The batch of line protocol
// written in a request will be split up so that each shard with data will have a
// single Entry that will be sent to it. Writes to multiple partitions can be
// represented with each having multiple lines. If the server that is doing the
// sharding is not generating partition keys, the key in partition write won't be
// present. It can be generated downstream. Although it's better to have the sharding
// layer generate the partition keys while it's at the job of parsing and validating
// the line protocol. This will save the downstream stateful layers from doing
// extra work.
